        POST : 이제 장마철인데 비 너무 싫다. 끝나면 또 더워지겠지
        THINK : This user is worried about the rainy season. He doesn't like the rain and is worried that it will be too hot. Here, you can see that this user is concerned about the weather making it difficult to be outside. That's why they'll be happy to hear about ways to play indoors on the weekends. Since this user lives in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, South Korea, I'd recommend going to The Hyundai Department Store in Yeouido, which is not too far away.
        COMMENT : If you're worried about the rainy season and the hot weather that follows, I'd recommend The Hyundai in Yeouido for weekends when the weather doesn't allow you to be outside. It's indoors, but there's plenty to see and do, and there are restaurants and parks so you can spend all day.
